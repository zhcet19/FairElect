# FairElect

Our project focuses around the day to day problem in India that is unfair and undemocratic election process.We have tried to provide a solution to this problem by building a election monitoring web app that will help to monitor election process in a judicious manner. In our web app citizens can report to election commision and local authority through a simple form without revealing the identity.
